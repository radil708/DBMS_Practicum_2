This repo is meant to be a showcase code I have worked on for potential employers

Languages: R, SQL

Features:
	- Data Mining
	- Transformation of XML into a relational database (MySQL)
	- Database design
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High Level Requirements:

	- Create a normalized relational schema that contains the following entities/tables: 
		Articles, Journals, Authors
	- Realize the relational shcema in SQLite
	- Extract and transform the data from the XML and then load into the appropriate 
		tables in the database
	- Write queries  to populate a fictitious dashboard that would allow an analyst to explore 
		whether the number of publications show a seasonal pattern
	- Create a line graph that shows the average days elapsed between submission and publication
		 for all journals per quarter.

The code includes comments and answers to questions specifically asked by the project requirements.
